      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to Netlify
        uses: netlify/actions/cli@master
        with:
          args: deploy --dir=dist --prod
        env:

## 🌟 Best Practices for Rural Schools

1. **Offline First:** Ensure content works without internet
2. **Mobile Optimized:** Most students will use phones/tablets  
3. **Low Bandwidth:** Optimize images and assets
4. **Progressive Enhancement:** Core features work on older browsers
5. **Local Deployment:** Consider local servers for remote areas

## 📞 Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check the deployment logs
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Test the build locally first
4. Check platform-specific documentation

## 🎯 Quick Deploy Commands

```bash
# Local testing
npm run serve:local

# Deploy to Netlify
./scripts/deploy.sh netlify

# Deploy to Vercel  
./scripts/deploy.sh vercel

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
./scripts/deploy.sh gh-pages
```
